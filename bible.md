Her and her sister, Nina Williams, were prominent fighters in Tekken, who were constantly out for each other’s throats, literally.

So much so that when they breached Sir August de Wynter’s Wonderland Weather London Headquarters by beating up all of the security guards, they were hired to be the sole security guards of the building.

However, their security guard abilities leave much to be desired, as they spend most if not all of their time beating up each other instead of looking out for potential intruders. Because of this, there are many intruders at the facility. Despite this, Anna and Nina manage to be just good enough not to get fired and remain a wild card due to their abilities.

She took advantage of the fact Ann Reardon copyrighted the word “disinformation” to shut down anyone trying to expose her as a vessel for Zygote Swelles.

AXIS
 	“I hope your island explodes.”

Name: Alisher Kasimdzhanov
Origin Point: Stansbury Park Observatory Complex (Utah, NA)
Affiliation: SYNDROME (tennous), LADY BONE DEMON, OVERDIE 
Class: Spellcaster
Threat level: EXPIRED (DISLOYAL)
Skills:
Bio:
Axis was born in Utah. He bullshitted his way through life and managed to get a PhD. He eventually found out how to control which timeline he was in and then used it to fix all his mistakes and make himself the “smartest person to ever have lived”, being very successful academically and being a very accomplished chess player. He manipulated time to make it seem like Manfred von Freicch sacrificing a pawn in his titular gambit was a genius maneuver when in fact it was a blunder. Despite this, the Manfred von Freicch Gambit has become a staple of honor for all grandmasters in the world, bar the amish community. Axis casually has the ability to warp time to ensure he’ll always have the right move in chess, even if the “right” move only confuses the opponent.

He is a known dozen-agent, as his loyalty wavers near constantly. He also makes terrible jokes with the word “axis” in them. Like “axis-tually.”

He got a job as a technician in the Luxembourg lab, led by Sir August de Wynter, but decided to get himself fired. Syndrome saw this and decided Axis would be a viable asset to the Nomanisan Island team. Axis got fired again due to betraying Syndrome, and started doing mischievous things around the world, and established a residency in Jupiter’s Great Red Spot.. He flew under the radar for the most part until the grand Monte Carlo invasion, where he took over Sir August de Wynter’s casino to rig all of the games. OVERDIE showed up to stop him and, defeated, he agreed to join.

Axis knew Syndrome well after working with him for years, and used this to his advantage to identify his weaknesses and relay them to OVERDIE agents. He knew that there was a Kronos room that unveils people, due to witnessing this happen to Mr. Incredible many times. After many agents fell victim to Syndrome’s trap, he, along with Killian, Yeon Kyo, and Gladys Sharp, saved the captured agents and together, they defeated Syndrome. 

After Syndrome’s defeat, Axis tells Mirage that he wants something else to do. She suggests he joins OVERDIE, and he declines. She suggests, then, that they join the Lady Bone Demon. Axis gets connections after finding Peng on badjokes.com, later befriending them on Skype,  and manages to get hired for Lady Bone Demon.

He did well as a soldier for Lady Bone Demon, and was one of her more loyal members, never questioning any of her tactics or actions. After Marlene’s death by the Mayor, he got into an argument with Mirage on whether or not their methods had gone too far. Mirage quits being a member, while Axis stays. When Lady Bone Demon activates the phase where she begins taking control of her helpers. As he realizes he is beginning to become a puppet, his ego is bruised and he flies to an exoplanet to try and stop the process.

 He is chased by Macaque and Walter White, who Lady Bone Demon uses to fight Axis. Axis activates a supernova at the exoplanet, which half-removes her control from him, the entire control from Macaque, with all of it funneling onto Walter White. He and Macaque join OVERDIE (and later THE COUNCIL) again to fight Lady Bone Demon.

	During the final battle, Axis’s vessel half gets the better of him and he dies. Now, he is a spirit that mainly crashes Blizzard’s servers, and tells Syndrome bad ideas, such as eating his own chess pieces, reminiscing the very first time he betrayed him, by teaching him all the wrong moves in chess.

He founded SHM with Cousin Mel and is well respected by his colleagues at SHM and other prestigious law firms. However, by 2001, Chuck began to claim to suffer from electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS), essentially an adverse physical reaction to electrical devices, which made it challenging for him to lead a normal life. After Chuck steps away from SHM due to his claim of electromagnetic hypersensitivity, Cousin Mel enables him to work from home while Jimmy takes care of Chuck's personal needs.
Despite Jimmy admiring his older brother and initially believing him to be supportive of him as a lawyer, Chuck reveals to greatly resent his brother for his past actions as a conman, and believes him to be completely unfit to be a lawyer. Chuck prevents Jimmy from being hired by SHM and proceeds to create a majority of the obstacles he faces early on in his career. Chuck has a tumultuous and complicated relationship with Jimmy, with the two brothers often not seeing eye to eye and Chuck having conflicting views on how he feels about Jimmy, and he is unintentionally largely responsible for turning Jimmy into the criminally-inclined lawyer Saul Goodman that he later becomes.
After mistakenly arriving at the wrong address, he became Lady Bone Demon’s lawyer. He soon replaced the Mayor as Lady Bone Demon’s favorite employee, after telling him he wasn’t a real lawyer, depowering him instantly.

Name: Evil Evil Evil Evil Evil Evil Mr. Incredible
Origin Point: Unknown
Affiliation: Everyone
Threat level: Agreed on
Skills: Negotiation, Ambidextrous, Diplomacy
Bio: 
Was legally named Evil x6 Mr. Incredible due to her unfortunate parental alignment. Hopes to one day be named John Hexadicion. She works a 8-13 job at the local Evil power plant, where he is tasked with disposing of nuclear waste, and unfortunately has undergone mutations which led to Syndrome recruiting them to use as a test subject and a base to future Evil Mr. Incredibles.

Due to having so many “Evil”s stabled on to his name, Hexadicion is unable to know for sure if they’re supposed to be evil or not. Just to be sure, Hexadicion attempts to only perform actions that could be seen as “morally on their side” from any major side of a conflict. She is incredibly good at appearing to be on all sides at all times, being the only entity in existence that can be at least friendly acquaintances with every life form at once. The only person in reality that knows about Hexadicion’s “secret” is IVAN OOZE, hiring her as his “infinity-agent,” gathering information from every single faction in existence.

Her favorite color is morally gray. They use any pronouns 🙂

He may only be defeated by Christopher Nolan, using reverse entropy.

Syndrome tried to jump on the developing Evil Mr. Incredible bandwagon, just like how he tried being Incrediboy; he used the blueprints made from the trials he put Hexadicion through to formulate the most likable and popular version of Mr. Incredible, finally wanting to make his dream come true. Everyone absolutely hated the idea. This made him permanently quit his super villain ventures, returning to his life as the canned-goods guy. It took him a strangely short amount of time for his body to return to form from his octagon-shaped body.

IXE-Credible is the definition of power creep, and therefore everyone wants his powers for their own gain.

	Temporarily assumed the identity of “Billi the Vet” while hiding in the Scottish Highlands. He introduced beavers back into the Highlands, which quickly became an invasive species and destroyed the natural ecosystem.

	De Wynter quit being a vet after this, as he no longer desired to experiment on animals. He was hired as the CFO of the Luxembourg Lab, a medical lab specializing in rare diseases. Many successful yet questionable doctors worked under him, such as Dr. Pederson and Dr. Pkitter, but his lab wouldn’t face any issues for the time being. Until he hired Axis and Enobia, who at the time were known as Dr. Gyashek and Dr. Wagner.

	His medical lab went under a few months after Enobia attempted a risky and experimental treatment on a patient, mainly because of his team’s questionable medical strategies. Wynter returned to Scotland, to study meteorology, and got a genius idea to make an obscene amount of money. He spent the next seven years building the Prospero Project to control the weather at a global scale.

	His plan worked at first, getting a cut of every UN country’s GDP to allow their weather to not be impossibly cold. He was stopped by OVERDIE and The Avengers due to his threat level. His weather machine still works, and now works in an underground weather ring known as Wonderland Weather.

	De Wynter was killed after being struck by lightning after being told “SILENCE” by his long term rival, Mayor Scamboli.

SYNDROME 
“It tore me apart.” 

Name: Buddy Pine Claus 
Origin Point: The Incredibles (2004), Nomanisan Island (South Pacific Ocean), Municiberg (Illinois, NA)
Affiliation: HIMSELF
Class: Spellcaster 
Threat level: EXTREME
Skills:
Bio:
Buddy is Santa Claus’ third and youngest son. He hates his father, and previously wished Mr Incredible would be his dad. He spread the rumor that it’s common knowledge that Syndrome’s Mother was a groupie for Mr. Incredible.



	As a child he told Shrek to do the roar, which after much persistence, Shrek eventually did. He even paid a man to pretend to be his father to further pester Shrek. 

In his youth, the T-X became a mother figure to him after she was sent back in time to kill him. 

Buddy soon gained a liking to Mr Incredible, and saw him as the father he never had. He wanted to be a hero just like him, and invented rocket boots to help him, but was rejected. Mr Incredible even told him his superhero name was horrible! 

When he was a teenager he became terminally online, spending most of it on DeviantArt and primitive YouTube, making rants about Mr Incredible. He eventually gained online infamy as the “canned-goods guy”, and had his address displayed in Times Square. As a result of this humiliation, he ran away to Nomanisan Island. 

“Mr Incredible’s eyes narrowed in realization, “Canned goods-guy…?” Syndrome commanded the Omnidroid to throw him to the ground in rage. “No! I’m not the canned-goods guy!”
Buddy eventually went under a new online name, Syndrome,  and sold his inventions, becoming incredibly wealthy. He began being investigated by the IRS, and was about to go to jail for tax fraud until Mirage stepped in to become his bookkeeper, and blamed it all on Gazerbeam, who got sentenced to execution by firing squad. Syndrome caught the feds to the chase, of course, luring him to a cave to die unpeacefully.

Syndrome used his intelligence to build weapons and other devices to sell it to foreign governments. Upon acquiring billions of dollars selling his weapons, he built a facility in Nomanisan Island, spending most of it on his own personal KRONOS ROOM. He moved in with Mirage there, and hired many nomanisan workers to carry out the grunt work. He ran out of money building this facility, so he decided to create “The Harvester”, a ransomware virus targeting the very governments he got so much money from in the past.

He invented the Omnidroid, a robot designed to learn how to fight against supers and them. To train the Omnidroid, he put it up against supers, such as the Loonatics. This proved to be successful, as the Omnidroid killed all of its targets. However, Tech E. Coyote found out the password to the KRONOS ROOM, sealing Syndrome’s fate. Despite his efforts, they could not defeat Mr. Incredible, so then he decided to look for second opinions through hiring other people. He hired Gladys Sharp, Axis, and Enobia to find ways to defeat Mr. Incredible.

The Harvester, after gaining sentience, turned against Syndrome, and began to form OVERDIE. 

Most of Syndrome’s attempts to catch Mr. Incredible were foiled by an organization he was part of called OVERDIE. Syndrome realized that if he wanted to kill Mr. Incredible, he would have to destroy OVERDIE as a concept. So then he redesigned his KRONOS ROOM to catch intruders and send them to the torture device.

He had a very silly way to capture these people but he had a very sinister reason behind such a peculiar method. He would sell images of OVERDIE agents being unveiled and would sell them to people on the internet for obscene prices. You know why. Despite finding some success, OVERDIE won in the end, after Syndrome got betrayed by Axis again.

After a long time of failing to destroy Overdie, Mirage promised him a vacation in the Bahamas, but on the flight there, she revealed in a pre-recorded video message he was actually being sent to the Old Beach. 

“No! Help! Someone get me out of here!” Syndrome screamed as he pressed his hands up against the window of the jet “I don't want to be old!”

While he was at the Old Beach, Syndrome tried to make the best of his situation. He was accompanied by Zygote Swells, who was disguised as Mirage, and Axis, who was now a parasite in his mind telling him bad ideas. Some vacation…

 She disappears one day, returning to her own timeline and killing Terminator Genisys on the way, leaving Syndrome to be on his own once again.

She returns again while Syndrome gets shot at by OVERDIE and their guns. She takes the bullet for him, and tells him in an incredibly dramatic scene, that he should keep living life, and that she, despite being built to be a coldhearted killing machine, learned to love the very human that she was sent to kill.

	The plan to terminate Syndrome failed when T-X gained sentience and not only showed mercy to Syndrome, but also became his mother figure. As a result, Skynet was overshadowed by Syndrome’s omnidroids, thus becoming a less valuable company.

	Skynet’s CEO, known as John Connor, took it upon himself to turn himself into a terminator, and changed the company’s name to “Genisys” to try and garner interest. Terminator Genisys refers to the idea of the Genisys, although most of it can be attributed to John Connor’s Terminator Form.

Origin Point: Nomanisan Island (South Pacific Ocean)
Affiliation: OVERDIE
Class:
Threat level: NONE
Skills:
Bio:
	WidWo was built by Syndrome to be a super computer virus called “The Harvester”. Syndrome used her to hack into government databases to blackmail them, and also to get information about supers. She gained her personality and speech pattern from when Syndrome was a forum user in middle school . 

She eventually was turned into a physical being, a robot, to be more effective as a hacker, and as a subconscious replacement for the T-X.

	WidWo eventually broke out of her shackles, and gained sentience. The first thing she did was become a pop star, known as the “SP/DER LILY”. Despite her very successful musical career, what she truly wanted was to stop Syndrome. When Syndrome started deploying his omnidroids to destroy cities worldwide, WidWo attempted to fight them off and stop Syndrome on her own. When she realized she couldn’t, she figured out that the only way to stop Syndrome was to gather the greatest supervillains in the world in a group, to defeat this greater evil. 

	Unfortunately, she was outsmarted by Syndrome. Most of her agents fell victim to the KRONOS room trap, because she was on vacation in the Bahamas. She made sure that in future vacations she would at least have an internet connection so she can be reached.

After Syndrome’s defeat, WidWo kept OVERDIE running for greater evils that would threaten the world.

She is in a toxic romance with the Lady Bone Demon, who sees her as a replacement for her ex-girlfriend (who was also a purple spider woman).

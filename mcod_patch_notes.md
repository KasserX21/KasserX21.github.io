## Rev Runner

Momentum
- Now only applies to solid blocks
- Passive speed gain doubled
- Max speed reduced from 43 m/s to 24 m/s

Laser Spear
- New main weapon

All Rev'd Up
- Now has a cooldown of 18 seconds
- Additional speed increased from 1 m/s to 10 m/s

Shockwave
- No longer directly damages enemies in front of you
- Now creates an explosion behind you to propel you forward
- Now renders you immune to fall damage for 3 seconds
- Added a 0.8 second delay before you lose all speed

-# Notes: Ever since 41-50, Rev Runner has felt like a product of his time, where we were just getting to understand the more advanced intricacies of Minecraft coding and messing around. This rework is meant to de-jankify and modernize the character, by making the abilities work more in tandem with each other, and give more feedback on what they're doing to the player. The spear was added to be an exciting new addition made possible by the Big Boy update, as well as replacing his old weapon that didn't work well with the character literally moving faster than the server can handle.


## Pinja

- Base size reduced by 15%

Star Collecting
- Base size increased by 10% per level

Bat
- Attack cooldown decreased from 1.8 to 1 second
- Reach increases by 25% per level
- No longer stuns

Stun Bat
- Attack cooldown increased from 1.8 to 2.4 seconds
- Stun damage conditions removed
- Weapon must fully charge before stunning
- Reach increases by 15% per level
- Damages starts at 1 and increases by 1 per level
- Stun duration scales with Star Level

Bomb
- Bombs new exude a particle effect and play a sound exactly 1 second before exploding

-# Notes: We've been brainstorming Pinja's modernization for a while, mostly with their size and reach growing to be more accurate to the source. Bat and Stun Bat got separated since the old version was a little annoying to play with and against since it was a pretty arbitrary condition and it sucks getting stunned. So we've separated them, into the primary damage dealing and bomb-enabling Normal Bat, and the play-enabling Stun Bat.


## Elizabeth

DANGEROOOOUS JUNGLE
- Duration reduced from 10 to 5 seconds
- Now provides Elizabeth with Speed II near the spawner

BATTLE NO. 1
- Removed

MARVELOUS (New Ability)
- Cooldown: 4 seconds
- Provides Elizabeth with Resistance X for 1 tick
- Receiving damage during the tick provides a Marvelous Parry
- Having received damage 1 tick before or after use can provide a Great Parry
- Marvelous and Great Parries both provide Elizabeth with 4 overhealth
- Marvelous Parries reset the cooldown for MAGiC4LG1RL M3GA S7R1KE!
- Marvelous Parries make the next shot of LETHAL;WEAPON twice as fast to fire
- Getting a Marvelous Parry during SUPER REACTOR doubles the damage of the next shot

LETHAL;WEAPON
- 12 damage range increased from 5 to 12 blocks
- 6 damage range increased from 10 to 20 blocks
- Minimum damage increased from 1 to 3
- Maximum range increased from 20 to 30 blocks

-# Notes: Elizabeth was pretty hard to balance. Surprisingly, she was really on a knife's edge, where making her railgun do more damage broke her and nerfing Battle No. 1 made her too weak. The balance patterns of the 1.20 days pushed her too much into the close-range brawler direction, which was incentivized due to the existence of Battle No. 1. We hope that with these balance changes, Elizabeth will be more incentivized to play at range as her tankiness is much reduced. We replaced Battle No. 1 with a tick-perfect parry, to fit more with her identity as a rhythm game character, and to give a little strength in close-range combat to make her not super weak to dives.



## Laverna

Corruption Beam
- Damage reduced from 6 to 2
- Firerate increased from 0.8 to 2.5 per second
- Now accelerates the cooldown of "Laverna's Checklist" by 100%

Laverna's Checklist
- Cooldown per life fruit increased from 6 to 8 seconds

Laverna's Formula
- No longer uses the weird damage boost thing
- Now reduces the target's armor by 10 and removes all armor toughness for the duration
- Also steals the enemy's overhealth and applies it to yourself

Fairy Wings
- Ability removed
- Laverna is now passively equipped with an elytra that disables gravity during use

-# Notes: Laverna was a very uninteractive character, chosen only for the sole purpose of spamming life fruits. With this rework, we hope that her other abilities will get used more, as well as giving her a more active playstyle that the player is incentivized to utilize.


## Lady Doppler

Forecast
- "Attack in the future" feature removed

Cold Front
- Damage increased from 3 to 5

Lightning Strike
- Cooldown reduced from 5 seconds to 3 seconds

-# Notes: Forecast has been a buggy nightmare, so we decided to ultimately do away with it, and buff the other aspects of her kit to make her an option for longer-range combat, a style that the Combat class is less populated with.


## Lady X

- All applied effects now extend to mobs

__Subclass Changes__

Lady Doppler: Controller -> Poke
